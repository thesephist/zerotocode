In this milestone, we'll meet some new, more interesting, interactive HTML elements like buttons and inputs, and we'll dive deeper into CSS by looking at how we can use CSS properties to move things around on our page.

## Part 1: Semantic HTML

In milestone 1, we encountered some simple HTML tags like `<p>` and `<h1>` that corresponded to chunks of text on our page. There's also a set of HTML tags that correspond not to specific parts of text, but to _sections of a webpage_, like headers, footers, articles, sidebars, and navigation menus.

## Part 2: Inputs and buttons

## Part 3: Layout with CSS

### The CSS Box Model

<!-- composing selectors with parent-child hierarchies -->

## Part 4: Let's build a form!
