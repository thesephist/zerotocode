      <description>In this milestone, we&amp;rsquo;ll get acquainted with HTML and CSS, two of the key building blocks of every website. Using what we learn, we&amp;rsquo;ll build a very simple About page for you.
This milestone is a bit longer than the usual, and covers more ground than the usual, to help you get up and running. Rather than try to finish everything here in one sitting, find stopping points, and take your time to experiment with code samples provided here to really get a sense of how these key technologies (HTML and CSS) work.</description>

      <description>Before you begin working through the milestones, this overview covers a few things you should know to move through the course, including what you&amp;rsquo;ll learn, how to use our code editor, Codeframe, and how to learn to code effectively using the resources available online, in addition to what&amp;rsquo;s here already.
What we&amp;rsquo;ll learn Zero to Code is a course about making interesting, useful things on the web using technologies that are core to any website: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</description>
